we'll create a basic voting application where users can vote for their favorite candidate.

Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of blockchain, Ethereum, and smart contracts.
Install MetaMask extension in your browser to interact with Ethereum networks.
Let's get started with the steps:

Step 1: Set up the Development Environment
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

Step 2: Create a New Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

Step 3: Initialize the Project
Initialize a new npm project and install necessary dependencies:

npm init -y
npm install ethers
npm install dotenv

Step 4: Create a Smart Contract
Create a new file called Voting.sol and define the smart contract. This contract will store candidates and their votes
Step 5: Compile the Smart Contract
You can use an online Solidity compiler or a local development environment like Remix to compile the contract. Obtain the compiled ABI and bytecode.

Step 6: Set up Ethereum Wallet and Smart Contract Deployment
In this step, you need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether for gas fees. You can use the Ropsten testnet for development purposes.

Step 7: Interact with Smart Contract from JavaScript
Create a new file called app.js to interact with the deployed smart contract using the ethers.js library.

Step 8: Run the Application

Run your application using Node.js:

node app.js
